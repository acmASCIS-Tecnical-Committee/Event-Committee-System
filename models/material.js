// Def: Material is something that we can buy from a store (example balloons)
// Data details can be found on a trello card named the same name as this file
// this is a schema for how the material instance will look like in the DB
// you will need mongoose 'mongoDB' to import the schema module
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// use mongo schema as Schema
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
